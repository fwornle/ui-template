### TodoWrite - 2025-11-30 06:35:22 UTC [07:35:22 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically to capture all technical details, decisions, and the current state of work.

**Initial Context (from previous session):**
The conversation started as a continuation from a previous session where:
1. Phase 1 was completed: Integrated template features from `~/Agentic/timeline` into `~/Agentic/ui-template` (TopBar, BottomBar, Logger, ThemeProvider, etc.)
2. Phase 2 was started: AWS backend integration from `~/Agentic/curriculum-alignment`
3. A plan was created at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/plans/wild-nibbling-parasol.md`

**User Messages in this session:**
1. "stuck?" - User asking if I was stuck (I wasn't, just continuing)
2. "write a step-by-step integration manual (md) to show me what to do in order to deploy this to dev, int, prod and get it up-and-running. Then include a link to this guide in the main README.md. Add architecture diagrams (plantuml -> png) in both the deployment guide (detailed) as well as the README (overview)"

**Phase 2 Implementation - AWS Backend Integration:**

Files created:
1. `template.yaml` - SAM template with Lambda, API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, Cognito
2. `samconfig.toml` - Multi-environment SAM configuration (dev/int/prod)
3. `lambda/api/index.ts` - Lambda handler with API routes
4. `lambda/api/package.json` and `tsconfig.json` - Lambda TypeScript setup
5. `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Test workflow
6. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI/CD deployment workflow
7. `src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts` - Cognito authentication service
8. `src/store/slices/authSlice.ts` - Redux auth state management
9. `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Authentication hook
10. `src/components/auth/LoginModal.tsx` - Login/signup UI
11. `src/services/apiClient.ts` - API client with token management
12. `.env` and `.env.example` - Environment configuration

Files modified:
1. `src/store/index.ts` - Added authReducer
2. `src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx` - Added login/logout functionality
3. `package.json` - Added aws-amplify dependency and SAM scripts

**TypeScript Errors Fixed:**
1. TopBar.tsx - Removed unused 'User' import from lucide-react
2. cognitoService.ts - Fixed type incompatibility with `Partial<Record<string, string | undefined>>` for attributes

**Documentation Phase (current):**
1. Created `docs/deployment-guide.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
2. Created `docs/puml/aws-architecture.puml` - Detailed architecture diagram
3. Created `docs/puml/architecture-overview.puml` - Overview diagram for README
4. Created `docs/puml/cicd-flow.puml` - CI/CD deployment flow diagram
5. Copied `_standard-style.puml` to the project
6. Generated PNG files for all diagrams
7. Updated `docs/deployment-guide.md` to include CI/CD flow diagram
8. Updated `README.md` with architecture overview, links to deployment guide, and documentation references

**Build Verification:**
- `npm install` - Successful (added 154 packages)
- `npm run build` - Successful (produced 580.99 kB JS bundle)

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Phase 1 (from previous session, completed)**: Integrate template features from `~/Agentic/timeline` into `~/Agentic/ui-template` (TopBar, BottomBar, Logger, ThemeProvider, auth components, settings, light/dark/system mode)
   - **Phase 2 (completed in this session)**: Integrate AWS backend from `~/Agentic/curriculum-alignment`:
     - Deploy to prod, int, and dev environments
     - Authentication via AWS Cognito
     - Serverless Lambda function
     - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (push to develop → dev, push to main → int, tag v* → prod)
     - Preserve local development with `npm run dev`
   - **Documentation (completed)**: Create step-by-step deployment manual, add architecture diagrams (PlantUML → PNG) to both the deployment guide and README

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) for infrastructure as code
   - AWS Lambda with Node.js 20 runtime
   - AWS API Gateway with Cognito Authorizer

7. Pending Tasks:
   - None - all requested tasks have been completed

8. Current Work:
   The most recent work was completing the documentation request. I:
   1. Created `docs/deployment-guide.md` with comprehensive deployment instructions
   2. Created three PlantUML diagrams: aws-architecture.puml, architecture-overview.puml, cicd-flow.puml
   3. Generated PNG files for all diagrams in `docs/images/`
   4. Updated `docs/deployment-guide.md` to include CI/CD flow diagram
   5. Completely rewrote `README.md` with architecture overview diagram, project structure, scripts table, deployment environments, and documentation links

   The todo list shows all 5 tasks completed:
   - ✅ Create deployment guide markdown file
   - ✅ Create detailed architecture PlantUML diagram
   - ✅ Create overview architecture PlantUML diagram
   - ✅ Create CI/CD flow diagram
   - ✅ Update README.md with link to guide and overview diagram

9. Optional Next Step:
   All explicitly requested tasks are complete. The user should:
   1. Review the deployment guide at `docs/deployment-guide.md`
   2. Configure AWS credentials and GitHub secrets
   3. Deploy using `npm run sam:deploy:dev` or push to GitHub for CI/CD deployment

   No immediate next step is required unless the user requests additional changes or has questions about the deployment process..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
