### Text Exchange - 2025-12-06 10:07:36 UTC [11:07:36 CEST]

**User Message:** when resizing the window, the main menu collapses to a hamburger (as expected), but the logo remains - which creates a weird overlap: [Image #1]\
Also, clicking the dark/light mode icon often requires me to click twice before the action happens
