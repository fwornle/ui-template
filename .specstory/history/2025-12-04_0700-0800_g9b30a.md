**User Message:** I want to add a mkdocs documentation like in ~/Agentic/nano-degree, incl. the build pipeline which, upon committing any changes to the underlying documents, re-builds the published documentation. create a skill which can be used to add such a set-up and documentation from the contents of the docs folder to whichever repo it runs from

### Read - 2025-12-04 06:45:50 UTC [07:45:50 CEST]

**User Request:** does it matter, that this repo already uses github actions to deploy the UI-Template app? Is this now conflicting with the docs build? Can you make it so that it only runs the mkdocs build when the contents of docs-content have been changed and other wise run the deployment? [Image #1]

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/.github/workflows/deploy.yml"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

     2→

     4→  push:
     5→    branches: [main, develop]
